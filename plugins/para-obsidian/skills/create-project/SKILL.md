# Create Project

Create PARA-compliant project notes with validated area connections through collaborative dialogue.

## Core Philosophy

**From Tiago Forte's PARA Method:**

- **Project** = Has a specific outcome AND deadline. Can be marked "complete."
- **Area** = Standard to maintain. Continuous, no end date.
- **Every project falls within an area** - they're interdependent.
- **Organize by actionability**, not subject matter.

This skill ensures projects are well-defined and properly connected to your life structure.

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS load areas first** - Never suggest areas that don't exist in the vault
2. **NEVER invent connections** - Only offer areas from the loaded list or create new ones
3. **Projects MUST have outcomes** - If no clear outcome, it might be an area instead
4. **Projects MUST have deadlines** - "Ongoing" means it's an area, not a project
5. **Area selection is REQUIRED** - Every project falls within an area
6. **Classification, not invention** - AI classifies into existing categories; user provides facts

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 0: Load Vault Context (ALWAYS FIRST)
    ↓
Phase 1: Gather Project Intent
    ├── What outcome?
    └── When complete? (validates it's a project)
    ↓
Phase 2: Area Selection (CRITICAL - prevents invalid areas)
    ├── Present numbered list from vault
    ├── User selects OR creates new
    └── NEVER accept free-text area names
    ↓
Phase 3: Confirm & Create
    ├── Present complete proposal
    ├── User approves or adjusts
    └── Create with validated frontmatter
```

---

## Phase 0: Load Vault Context

**ALWAYS fetch vault context before doing anything else:**

```
para_list_areas({ response_format: "json" })
para_list_projects({ response_format: "json" })
```

Store these lists for:
- Area validation in Phase 2
- Detecting duplicate project names
- Understanding user's current structure

**If user provides context in initial message**, still load areas first before responding.

---

## Phase 1: Gather Project Intent

### 1.1 Understand the Outcome

If not provided in initial message, ask:

```
I'll help you create a new project. Let me ask a few questions to ensure it follows the PARA method.

**What outcome do you want to achieve?**
(A project has a specific end result - something you can "complete")
```

**Good outcomes:**
- "Set up Clawdbot for my messaging apps"
- "Migrate database to PostgreSQL"
- "Plan Melanie's birthday trip"

**Bad outcomes (suggest area instead):**
- "Manage my health" → Area: Health
- "Stay on top of finances" → Area: Finance

### 1.2 Confirm Deadline

```
**When should this be complete?**
(PARA projects have deadlines - when will you know this is done?)

Examples: "2025-03-31", "end of Q1", "next month", "by Feb 28"
```

If user says "ongoing" or "no deadline":

```
That sounds more like an **Area** (ongoing responsibility) than a **Project** (specific outcome with deadline).

Would you like to:
1. **Create an area instead** - For ongoing responsibilities
2. **Set a target date** - Even rough estimates help (e.g., "sometime in Q2")
3. **Continue as project** - I'll use a placeholder date you can update later
```

### 1.3 Extract Title

From the outcome, suggest a clear project title:

```
Based on your outcome, I suggest:

**Title:** 🎯 [Clear Action + Object]

Examples:
- Outcome: "Set up Clawdbot" → 🎯 Clawdbot Setup & Integration
- Outcome: "Plan birthday trip" → 🎯 Melanie Birthday Trip 2025
- Outcome: "Migrate database" → 🎯 PostgreSQL Migration

Does this title work, or would you prefer something different?
```

## Phase 2: Area Selection

**CRITICAL: This phase prevents the "invalid area" bug.**

### 2.1 Present Valid Areas

Using the areas loaded in Phase 0, present a numbered list:

```
**Which life domain does this project belong to?**

Your existing areas:
1. 🎹 Movie Love
2. 🏠 Property
3. 🏡 Home
4. 🐶 Pet - Muffin
5. 📝 Note Taking
6. 🔧 Dotfiles
7. 🤖 AI Practice

Choose a number, or type "new" to create a new area first.
```

### 2.2 Handle User Selection

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Number (e.g., `7`) | Use that area: `[[🤖 AI Practice]]` |
| `new` / `create new` | Go to Phase 2.3 (Create Area Sub-flow) |
| Area name verbatim | Match against list, use if found |
| Invalid input | Re-prompt with numbered list |

**NEVER allow:**
- Free-text area entry that could create broken wikilinks
- Accepting areas not in the loaded list without explicit creation

### 2.3 Create Area Sub-flow (if "new")

```
**Creating a new area first...**

Areas are ongoing life responsibilities (no end date). Examples:
- 🏡 Home - Household maintenance and improvements
- 💼 Career - Professional development and work
- 🏃 Health - Physical and mental wellness

**What responsibility or life domain is this?**
```

After user provides name, discover the area template's destination first:

```
para_template_fields({ template: "area", response_format: "json" })
```

Then create:

```
para_create({
  template: "area",
  title: "[User's area name]",
  dest: "<discovered-dest>",
  response_format: "json"
})
```

Then continue with project creation using the new area.

---

## Phase 3: Confirm & Create

### 3.1 Present Complete Proposal

```
## Project Proposal

**Title:** 🎯 [Title from Phase 1.3]
**Outcome:** [Clear outcome statement]
**Deadline:** [Date from Phase 1.2]
**Area:** [[Area from Phase 2]]
**Status:** planning

### Generated Sections
- **Why This Matters:** [Generated from context - problem it solves, why now]
- **Tasks:** [First actionable steps to get started]

---

**Ready to create?** (yes / tell me what to change)
```

### 3.2 Handle Response

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `yes` / `y` / `looks good` | Create immediately |
| Specific feedback | Adjust and re-present OR apply and create |
| `cancel` / `no` | Abort gracefully |

### 3.3 Discover Template Metadata

Before creating, query the project template for its current structure:

```
para_template_fields({ template: "project", response_format: "json" })
```

Extract from response:
- `validArgs` → which args to pass (e.g., status, deadline, area field names)
- `creation_meta.dest` → destination folder
- `creation_meta.sections` → body section headings
- `creation_meta.titlePrefix` → emoji prefix (auto-applied)

### 3.4 Create Project Note

Use discovered values from Step 3.3 (`creation_meta.dest` for dest, `creation_meta.sections` for section headings, `validArgs` for field names):

```
para_create({
  template: "project",
  title: "[Validated title]",
  dest: "<discovered-dest>",
  args: {
    "<discovered-status-field>": "planning",
    "<discovered-deadline-field>": "[Validated date]",
    "<discovered-area-field>": "[Validated area from Phase 2]"
  },
  content: {
    "<discovered-why-section>": "[Generated content - problem it solves, why now]",
    "<discovered-tasks-section>": "- [ ] [First suggested task]\n- [ ] [Second task if applicable]"
  },
  response_format: "json"
})
```

### 3.5 Confirm Creation

```
Created: 🎯 [Project Title].md → [discovered-dest]
Linked to: [[Area Name]]

Would you like to:
1. **Add initial tasks** - Break down the first steps
2. **Link resources** - Connect existing notes
3. **Done** - Project is ready to go
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| No areas exist | Offer to create first area before project |
| Duplicate project name | Suggest alternative or confirm overwrite |
| Invalid date format | Re-prompt with examples |
| Area creation fails | Show error, retry area creation |
| Project creation fails | Show error, don't lose user's input |

AI: Which area does this project fall under?

    Looking at your areas, I'd suggest:
    - 🤖 AI Practice (since Clawdbot is AI-related)

    Choose a number (1-7), or type "new" to create a new area.

User: 7

AI: ## Project Proposal

    **Title:** 🎯 Clawdbot Setup & Integration
    **Outcome:** Set up Clawdbot for messaging apps

## Completion Signal

After creating the project, emit a structured completion signal so the brain orchestrator can parse the outcome:

- **Success:** `SKILL_RESULT:{"status":"ok","skill":"create-project","summary":"Created project: [name] in [[area]]"}`
- **Redirected to area:** `SKILL_RESULT:{"status":"ok","skill":"create-project","summary":"Redirected to create-area"}`
- **Cancelled:** `SKILL_RESULT:{"status":"ok","skill":"create-project","summary":"Cancelled by user"}`
- **Error:** `SKILL_RESULT:{"status":"error","skill":"create-project","error":"[error description]"}`
