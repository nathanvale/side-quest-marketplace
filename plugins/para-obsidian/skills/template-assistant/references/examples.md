  },
  content: {
    "Why This Matters": "Dark mode reduces eye strain during extended use and improves battery life on OLED devices. User feedback consistently requests this feature, with 47 mentions in the last quarter's support tickets. Competitors (Slack, Discord, Notion) already offer it, making this table-stakes for user retention.",
    "Success Criteria": "- [ ] Theme toggle accessible from Settings > Appearance\n- [ ] User preference persists across sessions and devices\n- [ ] All 50+ UI components render correctly in dark theme\n- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios maintained (4.5:1 minimum)\n- [ ] No performance regression (Lighthouse score stable)",

    "Next Actions": "- [ ] Audit current color usage in codebase (use grep for hardcoded colors)\n- [ ] Schedule design review with Sarah for token definitions\n- [ ] Create feature flag for gradual rollout",
    "Risks & Blockers": "- **Dependency:** Design team capacity for token definitions\n- **Technical:** Third-party components (date picker, charts) may not support theming\n- **Knowledge:** Unsure about handling user-uploaded images in dark mode"

Key insight: focus on identity change ('be a runner') rather than outcomes ('run a marathon').",
    "Key Insights": "1. **1% Better Daily**: Compound effects mean small improvements accumulate dramatically over time\n2. **Identity-Based Habits**: 'I am someone who...' is more powerful than 'I want to...'\n3. **Environment Design**: Make good habits obvious, bad habits invisible\n4. **Habit Stacking**: Attach new habits to existing routines\n5. **Two-Minute Rule**: Scale habits down to two minutes to start",
